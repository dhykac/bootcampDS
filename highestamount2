#For this function i used my samplehappycoke2.xlsx as dataset. This sample is recreated version with more than single product with the highest amount.
#In this code, there is slight improvement i made from my last work. Which is i use 'max()' to find highest amount product.
#This kind of code allow you to find two or more product with the highest amount among your items.
#You may follow step 1-5 from the last code since it wasn't much different except on the final step.

#The different part is where we replace 'which.max' to 'max(tab)'. Also, we should make a new variable for 'tabulate' to help us create the function.
tab <- tabulate(match(y,uy))
tab == max(tab)

#Then, make a function with them.
mode <- function(y) {
  uy <- unique(y)
  uy[tab == max(tab)]
}
mode(y)

#On the result, you could find there is two product has the highest amount among them.
#Feel free if you have any kind of question or better way for this code. ^_^
