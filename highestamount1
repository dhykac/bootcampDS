#This code is help you find the highest amount of your product from multiple bin of a storage or even a big warehouse with 2000 or more data row. 
#Then you could use the result to make a business movement such as promotional pack or discount for specific product.

#For this function i used my samplehappycoke.xlsx as dataset
#1. Make a vector using product name
y <- c(samplehappycoke$`Product Short Description`)

#2.Find unique value from your data by categorize it using 'unique'
uy <- unique(y)
uy

#3. Use 'match' for returns your vector and unique value by its position.
#this step will help us to change character category into numerical value
match(y,uy)

#4. Count the frequency for every category using tabulate
tabulate(match(y, uy))

#5. Use which.max to find numerical category for the highest frequency among your data
#then you can use unique value and which.max function to return numerical value into it's original 'character'
which.max(tabulate(match(y, uy)))
uy[which.max(tabulate(match(y, uy)))]

#6. You could also made a function to shorten the step
mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
mode(y)

#Notes : 
#This function will work only if you have single product with highest amount.
#Which means this function will not work if you have two or more product with highest amount.
#I will share how to find two or more highest amount product another time. Stay tune ^_^
